# Boyscouting

## Applies to

You're editing a file for an actual task and notice something small and
local you could fix in passing — a stale comment, a dead import, a
misnamed variable, a duplicated three-liner, a missing `.gitignore` entry
next to code you're already changing. Not: a defect worth its own tracking
(that's `propose-issue`), a stale factual claim in `wiki/`/`AGENTS.md`
(`wiki-sync`), or a deliberate broad tidy-up pass (`trim-docs`, or just say
what you're doing and do it as the actual task).

## The rule

**Leave the code better than you found it — the campsite rule — but only
the ground you're already standing on.** The scope is "touched by this
diff or immediately adjacent to it," not "anything in this repo I noticed
is imperfect." A boyscouting fix rides in the same commit as the task that
motivated it, described honestly in the commit message as incidental
rather than folded in silently.

## What qualifies

- Small, obviously correct, and reviewable in seconds alongside the real
  change — a typo, an unused variable, a comment that describes code three
  edits ago, a formatting inconsistency in a block you already rewrote.
- Confined to a file (or a couple of adjacent lines) you're editing for the
  actual task anyway. If you'd have to open a file you otherwise wouldn't,
  it's not boyscouting anymore — it's a separate task.
- Doesn't change behavior, an interface, or anything another module
  depends on. If you're not sure it's behavior-neutral, it needs the same
  verification as the main change, which usually means it isn't a quick
  tidy — see "bugs here serialize" in `AGENTS.md`: a small nearby edit can
  still combine badly with something else.

## What doesn't

- **A real bug**, even a tiny one, once it has a failure scenario — that's
  `propose-issue`, not a drive-by fix, unless Elly is right there and says
  fix it now.
- **A stale wiki/AGENTS.md claim** your change makes true or false —
  that's `wiki-sync`'s job specifically, in the same change, but follow
  that skill's steps rather than freelancing the wording.
- **Renaming or restructuring** something just because you'd have written
  it differently — no failure scenario, no incidental fix, just opinion;
  skip it or mention it and move on.
- **Anything that touches a file you weren't already going to touch.**
  That's scope creep wearing boyscouting's name — a separate task (or
  `propose-issue` if it's a bug, or a mention in your reply if it's not).
- **A module-style-guide violation found while merely reading**, not
  editing, the file — mention it, don't fix it uninvited.

## Why the boundary matters here

This repo is homelab-scale and reviewed by one person (`AGENTS.md`:
"Homelab, not production"). A diff that quietly grew past its stated
purpose is harder for Elly to review, not easier — a "fix the sops path"
PR that also silently reformats an unrelated module hides the actual
change inside noise. Small and honestly-labeled is what keeps this useful
instead of becoming the thing `ship`'s single-purpose-branch discipline
exists to prevent.

## Steps

1. Notice something small while editing a file you're already changing.
2. Ask "does fixing this need a file I wasn't already opening, or change
   behavior?" If yes to either, stop — it's not boyscouting; use
   `propose-issue`, `wiki-sync`, or a plain mention instead.
3. Make the fix, minimal and local.
4. Say so plainly when you report the change — "also fixed an unused
   import in the same file" — rather than letting it pass silently inside
   a diff described as doing only the main task. The commit message gets
   this too: a short trailing clause, not folded into the main summary
   line.
5. If the cleanup is real but bigger than a drive-by (more than a few
   lines, or a second file), stop and propose it as its own thing instead
   of doing it anyway.
