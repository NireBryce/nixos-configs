"""Find backtick-quoted file/path mentions across wiki/ and AGENTS.md that
don't resolve to any file actually tracked in the repo -- a name that was
renamed, moved, or removed out from under a doc that still mentions the old
one, the same failure `check_wiki.py`'s own docstring names as its whole
motivation ("a doc can say something the repo has stopped agreeing with and
nothing catches it"). `check_wiki.py links` already covers the reliable
half of this idea -- a real markdown link target either resolves or it
doesn't, no judgement call needed. This script covers the OTHER half: a
bare filename mentioned in backticks with no link at all (`elly-user.nix`,
`nireHost/hosts.nix`), which is common in this wiki's prose but genuinely
ambiguous to check mechanically, for reasons a first pass at this idea ran
into directly:

  - **Historical names are deliberately kept.** CLAUDE.md's own convention
    ("a bug recorded in a comment stays in the file") extends to prose:
    `virtualization-cube.nix`, `virtualization.nix`, `containers.nix`,
    `kde.nix`, `boot.nix` are all real former filenames this wiki
    deliberately still names while explaining a rename or removal. They
    will never resolve, and correctly so.
  - **Shortened paths are a real, intentional convention here.** This wiki
    routinely gives a path relative to `flake/modules/` or shorter still
    (`nireHost/hosts.nix`, `restic/restic.nix`) rather than the full
    repo-relative one -- resolved below by matching a tracked path's
    *suffix*, not requiring an exact match, but a path that additionally
    skips a middle directory (`flake/modules/nire/impermanence/
    WARN-impermanence.nix`, skipping the real `root-rollback/` component)
    defeats even that and still won't match.
  - **Some backtick spans aren't this repo's files at all** --
    `nixos/modules/services/misc/forgejo.nix` (nixpkgs' own tree, cited for
    comparison) and `akinomyoga/ble.sh` (an upstream GitHub repo, matched
    here only because it happens to end in `.sh`).
  - **styleguide.md names illustrative example filenames** (`golink.md`,
    `deep-dive-1.md`) that were never meant to exist.

None of that is something a script can reliably tell apart from a genuine
stale reference -- exactly the "script can't tell historical prose from a
live claim by itself" limitation `check_wiki.py`'s own docstring names, just
hitting harder here than anywhere that script actually checks. So, same
shape and same reasoning as `wiki_churn.py`: this is NOT a pass/fail gate.
It only lists candidates for a human to skim; nothing here fails a build or
blocks a commit. Expect real noise every run -- that's the trade for
catching the genuine case (a rename that really did leave a stale mention
behind) without missing it by trying to auto-filter the rest and getting
that wrong instead.

    wiki_stale_refs.py [repo-root]

Matches only against files git actually tracks (`git ls-files`) -- an
untracked file is invisible to the flake too (CLAUDE.md, "git add before nix
eval"), so treating it as "doesn't exist" for this purpose is the same
reasoning, not a separate rule.
